# AI Usage Report Format:

## AI Tools Used
- Primary tools: ChatGPT, Perplexity, and v0.dev
- Key use cases: For prompt generation, curation, and refinement, I primarily used ChatGPT and Perplexity (also for UI/UX improvement). I also experimented with MetaAI for image generation; however, I chose not to include those visuals to maintain a clean and uncluttered dashboard design. The entire process of code generation, website building, and deployment was handled end-to-end on v0.dev, using its AI-powered interface for efficient development.  

## Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)
Sample 1. "Iâ€™m building a modern, visually appealing, responsive **analytics dashboard** using **Next.js 14+ with App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS (or shadcn/ui / Chakra UI / MUI)** for a fictional platform called **"ADmyBRAND Insights"**. 

I need help designing and coding a beautiful dashboard interface focused on digital marketing metrics.

### ðŸŒŸ Overall Goal:
Create a stunning analytics dashboard that includes key metric cards, interactive charts, data tables, and a modern design system with dark/light mode toggle.

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Requirements:
- Consistent and clean design system (modern fonts, padding, shadows, etc.)
- Elegant visual hierarchy for better information clarity
- Smooth animations: hover effects, transitions, loading skeletons
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Dark/Light mode toggle

### ðŸ“Š Required Features:
- **Overview Page** with 4+ metric cards (Revenue, Users, Conversions, Growth %)
- **Charts Section** with at least 3 types: line chart, bar chart, pie/donut chart
- **Data Table**:
  - Sortable, filterable
  - Paginated
  - Supports mock or sample data
- Bonus: Simulate real-time updates using setInterval or similar logic
- Bonus: Export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- Bonus: Date range filters and dropdown filters

### ðŸ”§ Technical Stack:
- **Next.js 14+** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** or **shadcn/ui / Chakra UI / MUI**
- Charting library: **Recharts**, **Chart.js**, or **ApexCharts**
- Use mock data (generate realistic digital marketing stats)
- Component-based architecture (ChartCard, TableRow, MetricCard, etc.)

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure & Components:
Please suggest or scaffold a modular folder/component structure such as:
- `components/ChartCard.tsx`
- `components/MetricCard.tsx`
- `components/DataTable.tsx`
- `components/Navbar.tsx`
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `lib/data.ts` â€“ mock data
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` â€“ main dashboard
- `styles/` â€“ global and theme styles

### ðŸ“ˆ Mock Data Structure:
- Metrics: revenue, users, conversions, growth
- Daily/monthly user data
- Campaign performance per channel
- Sample table: campaign name, impressions, clicks, CTR, cost

### âœ… Output Needed:
- Code snippets for reusable components (metric card, chart, table)
- Example mock data for marketing analytics
- Animations using `framer-motion` or `Tailwind transitions`
- Dark/light mode toggle logic
- Suggestions for skeleton loading states
- Optional: Export to CSV/PDF logic

### âœ¨ Style Inspiration:
Modern dashboards like:
- Vercel Analytics
- Notion Metrics
- Linearâ€™s UI
- Google Analytics 4

Please help me scaffold the project and generate code step-by-step starting from layout to individual components. Ensure accessibility and performance best practices are followed."

Sample 2. "Create a full-fledged, colorful, and visually appealing portfolio website with working navigation. Each button (like Projects, Hackathons, Experience, etc.) should link to its own fully functional, scrollable page section or separate page, not just anchor links. Avoid basic white layouts â€” use a vibrant, modern UI with an eye-pleasing design. Include smooth transitions, hover effects, and clean typography. Optionally, add unique or out-of-the-box interactive features (like dynamic cards, animated timelines, or theme toggles) to make the site stand out."

Sample 3. "The button text is currently only visible on hoverâ€”please make it visible at all times. Also, change the side navigation bar color from white to a lavender shade. Ensure that all mentioned features and buttons are fully functional with a properly working backend. The dashboard should meet standard functional requirements expected from a proper dashboard. Additionally, there's high importance given to a beautiful and intuitive UIâ€”I like the current one, it's good, but if you can enhance and improve the UI further, please do so."

Sample 4. "Design a colorful, visually striking dashboard for ADmyBRAND, an innovative ad-tech platform. Integrate real-time stats on campaigns, budgets, impressions, conversions, and voice analysis, with interactive charts and an omnichannel overview. Use ADmyBRANDâ€™s logo colors for buttons and highlights. Include smart filters (date, channel, campaign type), dynamic notifications, and collapsible sidebars. Make the UI responsive with unique features like voice search, dark/light mode, team chat, and easy export/share. Prioritize a professional but vibrant lookâ€”avoid plain white, focus on gradients, shadows, and playful UI details to match the cutting-edge feel of ADmyBRAND."

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- AI-generated: Around 99% of the project was AI-generated.  
- Manual coding: While I didnâ€™t contribute direct manual coding due to the tech stack not aligning with my core expertise (which is primarily Python, HTML, and CSS), I went through nearly 23 iterations to refine the output.  
- Customization: I focused heavily on aligning the project with the specific requirements and incorporated several AI-generated suggestions with thoughtful customizations to ensure the final result met the expected functionality and design standards.
